         necessary DELETE request. Web browsers can’t send DELETE requests
         natively, so Rails fakes them with JavaScript. This means that the
         delete links won’t work if the user has JavaScript disabled. If you
         must support non-JavaScript-enabled browsers you can fake a DELETE
         request using a form and a POST request. -->
